# Transition Videos

This directory contains video files used for page transitions in the application.

## Required Files

- `page-transition.mp4` - A video file that plays during page transitions

## Video Requirements

- Format: MP4
- Duration: 1-2 seconds
- Resolution: At least 1280x720
- Content: Abstract digital transition effect with blue/purple hues
- Transparency: Should have alpha channel or dark background that blends well

Note: Since we can't directly create video files through this interface, you'll need to add an appropriate video file manually. Until then, the application will gracefully handle the missing video by using the CSS-based transition effects.
